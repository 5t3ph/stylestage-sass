# Style Stage Source Sass

> A minimal starter for Style Stage submissions that includes the source Sass used to create the base Style Stage theme, and the source HTML.

[Read the full guidelines](https://stylestage.dev/guidelines/) to ensure your final styles will be ready for inclusion in the showcase!

## To Use

1. Fork or select "Use this Template"
2. Once cloned to your computer, run `npm i` to install dependencies needed to compile the Sass
3. Run `npm start` to launch a hot-reload server that watches for Sass changes.

The final stylesheet will be placed in `public/style.css`.

You may alter anything and everything, but keep in mind that the final stylesheet should be unminified and ideally non-prefixed. All Style Stage submissions are parsed with `autoprefixer` during the publish build process, and unminified stylesheets are easier for visitors to learn from.

> If you change the output stylesheet name, be sure to update the link to it in `index.html`

## Submitting Your Stylesheet

Once you've created your stylesheet with this starter, publish this as a public repo and then you can use the GitHub link to the "raw" version of the `public/style.css` file for your final submission.

You will need to fork [the main Style Stage repo](https://github.com/5t3ph/stylestage) to add your stylesheet, as [explained in the FAQ](https://stylestage.dev/guidelines/#how-do-i-create-a-pull-request-pr).
